# DOM Manipulate Twitter Bot:
A simple Twitter Bot that I made which likes tweets which contain a specific string or hashtag. Feel feel to improvise and give advises.
## Technical Description:
* A simple bot written in python which makes use of selenium library and geckodriver for Mozilla FireFox.
* The operaions are done by the manipulation of DOM(Document Object Model) elements of the web page.
* **NOTE:** This may cause your account to be blocked by Twitter or you may see a re-captcha if it detects that you're automating(botting) and not a real human.
* The sleep times should be relaxed if the above happens.
* Please use a spare account because this is all experimental.
## Technologies Used:
1. **Python**: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
2. **Selenium**: Selenium is an open-source web-based automation tool.The Python APIs empower you to connect with the browser through Selenium. Selenium can send the standard Python commands to different browsers, despite variation in their browser's design.
3. **Mozilla FireFox**: Mozilla FireFox is a free and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards.
4. **Geckodriver**: Proxy for using W3C WebDriver compatible clients to interact with Gecko-based browsers. This program provides the HTTP API described by the WebDriver protocol to communicate with Gecko browsers, such as Firefox. It translates calls into the Marionette remote protocol by acting as a proxy between the local- and remote ends.
